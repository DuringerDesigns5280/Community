# Community

Community is your one-stop virtual space to find essential LGBTQ resources. A one-on-one private and secure chat with one of our verified Mentors may be just what you need because let's face it; we all deserve someone to talk to sometimes. Coming out can be such a dark and lonely place to be stuck in but with community it doesn't have to be. Connecting people at the start of their journey of self love with a mentor who has been in their shoes can help the process tremendously.
